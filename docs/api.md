# API and authentication

The HTTP API clients and UIs use, and how it and the engine's own calls to HFS are authenticated. Back to the [README](../README.md).

## API

| Method and path | Does |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/sources` | Every source: definition, state (`waiting`, `receiving`, `late`, `paused`), freshness, record counts, last file, last alert |
| `POST /api/sources` | Creates a source from its definition (the YAML as JSON); writes `sources/{id}.yaml` and starts it. `409` if it exists, `400` with the reason if invalid |
| `POST /api/sources/test` | Tests a connection: `{"source": {...}}` or a full definition. Answers `reachable`, `elapsed_ms`, `objects`, `newest`, `newest_at` |
| `GET /api/sources/{id}` | One source, as above |
| `PUT /api/sources/{id}` | Replaces the definition and restarts the source |
| `DELETE /api/sources/{id}` | Stops the source and removes its file; its records and alerts stay |
| `POST /api/sources/{id}/pause` | Stops polling and delivery until resumed; body `{"by": "..."}` is kept with the time |
| `POST /api/sources/{id}/resume` | Resumes and passes at once |
| `POST /api/sources/{id}/check-now` | Passes now instead of at the next poll |
| `GET /api/sources/{id}/loads` (also `/files`) | Every load: the file, its method, records read, sent, rejected, in progress, how long it took, where it is archived |
| `GET /api/loads/{id}` | One load with its **failures grouped by reason**: kind, reason, count, first line, and up to three sample rows each |
| `POST /api/loads/{id}/retry` | Puts the load's rejected rows back at the start, all of them or those with one reason (`{"reason": "..."}`); the source passes at once |
| `GET /api/sources/{id}/stats?days=14` | What a source's page draws: today (files, records, sent, rejected, pending) and one row per day |
| `GET /api/transforms` | Every transform file: name, path, size, modified, and the sources that use it |
| `GET /api/transforms/{name}` | The transform's code |
| `PUT /api/transforms/{name}` | Saves the code (`{"code": "..."}`); the sources using it restart their Python worker. `201` when new |
| `POST /api/transforms/{name}/try` | Runs the transform on `{"records": [...]}` (up to 100) without loading: per record, the resources it became or the rejection reason |
| `GET /api/monitoring/status` | What the monitoring page opens on: `needs_you` (late, paused, or rejecting sources with the reason), `last_24h` (files, sent, rejected, alerts), every source |
| `GET /api/records?source=&status=&file_id=` | Records; `status` is `received`, `pending`, `sent` or `rejected` |
| `GET /api/records/{id}` | One record: file, line, original and corrected row, resources sent, HFS response |
| `POST /api/records/{id}/reprocess` | Runs a record again; body `{"raw": {...}}` replaces the row and keeps the original |
| `GET /api/alerts?source=&open=true` | Alerts, newest first, each with its rule, recipients, channels, and when and why it cleared; `open=true` lists only those not cleared |
| `GET /api/alert-rules?source=` | Every rule; `POST` creates one (`400` names what is wrong with it) |
| `GET` / `PUT` / `DELETE /api/alert-rules/{id}` | One rule: read, replace, remove |
| `GET /metrics` | Prometheus text: records by status, last received time, paused flag, alerts by kind |
| `GET /health` | `{"status": "ok", "service": "hie", "version", "uptime_seconds", "started_at", "timestamp"}` |

## Authentication

With `HIE_AUTH_ENABLED=true`, every request under `/api` needs a bearer token signed by the identity provider: a JWT validated against `HIE_AUTH_JWKS_URL` with the expected `HIE_AUTH_ISSUER` and, when set, `HIE_AUTH_AUDIENCE`. This is the same validation HFS performs, through its `helios-auth` crate. `/health` and `/metrics` stay open. A missing or invalid token answers `401` with `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer`. A pause without a `by` in the body records the token's subject.

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `HIE_AUTH_ENABLED` | `false` | Require bearer tokens under `/api` |
| `HIE_AUTH_JWKS_URL` | | The identity provider's JWKS |
| `HIE_AUTH_ISSUER` | | Expected `iss`; required when enabled |
| `HIE_AUTH_AUDIENCE` | | Expected `aud`, when the provider sets one |
| `HIE_AUTH_ALGORITHMS` | `RS256,RS384,ES256,ES384` | Accepted signing algorithms |
| `HIE_AUTH_JWKS_MIN_REFRESH_INTERVAL` | `10` | Seconds between JWKS refreshes |

What a token may do is decided by its scopes (the `scope`, `scp` or `roles` claim, as HFS reads them):

| Scope | Grants |
|---|---|
| `hie/read` | Every `GET`: sources, loads, records, transforms, alerts, rules, monitoring |
| `hie/manage` | Changing sources, rules, loads and records (`POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, pause, resume, retry, reprocess, try), and reading |
| `hie/transforms` | `PUT /api/transforms/{name}`: code the engine then runs; and reading |
| `hie/*` | Everything |

A valid token without the scope a request needs answers `403` with the scope in `required`. A token from the same identity provider that carries only HFS scopes (`system/*.cruds`) is authenticated but may do nothing here.

`docker/keycloak/` holds a Keycloak for local work: HFS's `fhir` realm (its `hfs-backend-client`, which the engine uses towards HFS) plus the `hie/*` client scopes and three service-account clients, `hie-admin-client` (`hie/*`), `hie-operator-client` (`hie/manage`) and `hie-monitor-client` (`hie/read`), all with audience `hie-api`. `docker compose -f docker/keycloak/docker-compose.yml up -d` serves it on 8180; `docker/keycloak/get-token.sh [client]` prints a token. The engine then runs with `HIE_AUTH_JWKS_URL=http://localhost:8180/realms/fhir/protocol/openid-connect/certs`, `HIE_AUTH_ISSUER=http://localhost:8180/realms/fhir`, `HIE_AUTH_AUDIENCE=hie-api`, and `HIE_FHIR_TOKEN_URL=http://localhost:8180/realms/fhir/protocol/openid-connect/token` with `hfs-backend-client` / `hfs-backend-secret` towards an HFS configured for the same realm.

With auth off the engine logs a warning at start: `PUT /api/transforms/{name}` writes code the engine then runs, so an open API must only be reachable from trusted clients.

### The engine's identity towards HFS

The engine calls HFS as itself, with an OAuth2 **client-credentials** grant at the identity provider's token endpoint (Keycloak first; the same providers HFS accepts). The token is cached and renewed a minute before it expires; a `401` or `403` from HFS discards it, the rows wait, and the next pass goes out with a fresh one. A token endpoint that cannot be reached or refuses the client is a transient delivery failure, so the data is kept and the outage alerts say why. A wrong endpoint or secret fails at startup.

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `HIE_FHIR_TOKEN_URL` | | The provider's token endpoint, e.g. `https://idp/realms/hfs/protocol/openid-connect/token` |
| `HIE_FHIR_CLIENT_ID` | | The engine's client |
| `HIE_FHIR_CLIENT_SECRET` | | Its secret |
| `HIE_FHIR_SCOPE` | | Scopes to ask for, when the provider needs them, e.g. `system/*.cruds` |

With none of them set the engine calls HFS anonymously and logs a warning at start, which is what the public sandbox does against the public HFS. Setting some but not all three is refused.
